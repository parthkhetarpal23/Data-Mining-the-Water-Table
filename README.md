# Data-Mining-the-Water-Table
Predict the operating condition of a water point. 
3 Model files
1 Preprocessing file - Visualization and preprocessing was carried out of the data. 
1 Combined model file - Just prints all the accuracies of the models saved. 

When you run the preprocessing file, 2 new csv files will be generated.
These files will be used for the model notebook files. 
Models will be saved with a .sav extension so that you do not have to train the model time and again.
